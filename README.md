- The interface is generated dinamically using JavaScript;
- The counter can have negative numbers;
- The step can only be an integer between 1 and 100; floats are not allowed;
- Input validation for the step is done when clicking on the + or - button; if the input is invalid an alert is displayed on screen;
- Clicking on the reset button sets the counter to 0, but does not reset the step to 1;
- Reloading the page resets the counter to 0 and the step to 1.
